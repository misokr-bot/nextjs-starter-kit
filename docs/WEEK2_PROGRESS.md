## üí° Key Learnings

### React Patterns
- Context + Events provide powerful state management
- Custom hooks improve component reusability
- Alert dialogs enhance destructive action safety

### API Design
- Role hierarchies need explicit enforcement
- Last owner protection prevents system lockout
- Audit logging should happen after success

### UI/UX
- Confirmation dialogs critical for destructive actions
- Visual hierarchy (danger zones) improves clarity
- Real-time updates enhance perceived performance

## üé® Design Patterns Used

### Frontend
- **Context Pattern**: Organization state management
- **Custom Events**: Cross-component communication
- **Compound Components**: Alert dialogs with trigger/content
- **Controlled Components**: Form inputs with React state

### Backend
- **Middleware Pattern**: Permission enforcement
- **Repository Pattern**: Database operations in lib/organizations.ts
- **Guard Clauses**: Early returns for validation
- **Audit Pattern**: Comprehensive action logging

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- LocalStorage caching for current organization
- Event-based updates prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Pending invites fetched only once per organization
- API calls batched where possible

### Future Optimizations Needed
- [ ] Implement organization data caching
- [ ] Add optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Consider React Query for server state
- [ ] Add pagination for large member lists

## üîê Security Considerations

### Implemented Safeguards
- ‚úÖ Role-based permission checks (frontend + backend)
- ‚úÖ Last owner protection
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- ‚úÖ Audit logging for all sensitive operations

### Additional Security Needed
- [ ] Rate limiting on member operations
- [ ] CSRF protection on state-changing endpoints
- [ ] API key scope validation
- [ ] Session timeout on long-running operations

## üìñ Documentation

### Created Documentation
- [x] API endpoint documentation (inline JSDoc)
- [x] Component props documentation
- [x] Context usage examples
- [x] This progress report

### Documentation Needed
- [ ] Organization management user guide
- [ ] Member role permissions matrix
- [ ] API integration guide for developers
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
